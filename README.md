### Description

This code takes a screendump of your screen and puts it on the form. This can be used to make a form look transparent (although its not) or fool the user into thinking they're still looking at their screen but they're not, they're looking at a picture of their screen. Only half a page of code. The screen-shot below should prove useful. Feel free to comment.

Enjoy........
